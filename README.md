# Hexagonal Truth Landscapes

This project explores how truth, coherence, and meaning can be visualised using a hexagonal lattice and topological ideas. Built with D3.js, it simulates emergent truth-spaces as probabilistic, distributed patterns — more like evolving conversations than fixed facts.

## Why Hexagons?

Hexagons model neighbourhoods of shared understanding and allow smoother transitions between local "truth zones." They help surface relationships between individual and collective experience, especially when those relationships are uncertain, emergent, or in tension.

## Features

- Synthetic data generation (x, z positions + coherence values)
- D3-powered hexbin visualisation
- Interactive tooltips and colour-coded landscapes
- Potential for future integration with real-world discourse (e.g., Substack, Bluesky)

## Libraries Used

- [D3.js v7](https://d3js.org/) – for data-driven DOM manipulation and visualisation  
- [d3-hexbin](https://github.com/d3/d3-hexbin) – for creating hexagonal spatial bins

## Example Inspiration

While this project is conceptually unique, it draws visual inspiration from existing hexbin visualisations such as:

- **D3 Hexbin Gallery Example:**  
  https://observablehq.com/@d3/hexbin-map  
  *(Shows hexbin layout on a map — great for understanding how bins group data spatially)*

- **General D3 Gallery:**  
  https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery  
  *(Tons of charts and visual ideas using D3, including hexbin, scatter, force-directed, topology-inspired visuals)*

## Philosophy & Direction

This repo is public for now to invite exploration and feedback. However, the intent is not open-ended openness. Truth technologies are often co-opted by dominant groups to consolidate power. Misuse of emergent meaning frameworks could lead to manipulation, not insight.

As development progresses, access may be limited to collaborators who align with the spirit of the project: respectful, curious, and justice-aware.

## Licence

Currently unlicensed. The work is shared in the spirit of collaboration and exploration, not appropriation. A more explicit licence may be added later.

If you'd like to contribute or collaborate, reach out with your thoughts. Let’s build this carefully and consciously.
